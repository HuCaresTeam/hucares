Human and Cars Recognition System Server

W.I.P. The system is prone to change.
A system for recognizing plate numbers in order to track stolen/lost cars.

## The plan
The system will work by scanning through a camera list and proccessing images for any plate numbers. A backlog of all detected plate numbers will be kept for a predetermined time (most likely a week).
The second part of the project is the application, which will let officers or other government officials to insert cars that are stolen or missing. The detected backlog can then be accessed for those cars that are in the missing list (information about non-missing cars cannot be retrieved).

This project is being done as part of university course.
